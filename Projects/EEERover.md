## Synopsis

For the 1st year, end-of-year project we were tasked with designing and developing a rover with the appropriate circuits for recieving infra-red, magnetic and radio signals. I was responsible for developing a radio-pulse receiver circuit, which could take an encoded message (in the form
of a radio pulse) and convert it to a digital signal. I also helped write-up the project report.

## Skills

Below are the skills and experiences gained from the project:

* Competency with RF circuit design
* Competencies using circuit design tools such as LTSpice 
* Knowledge of basic RF circuit design and theory
* Experience working in a team
* Experience working with budgetary constraints
