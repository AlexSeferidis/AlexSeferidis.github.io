## Synopsis

A C90 to RISC-V compiler, written in C++. This was a spring term coursework assignment for Imperial module, `Instruction Set Architecture & Compilers' (IAC).

Below is an enumerative list of all the C90 features the compiler is capable of compiling into RISCV assembly:

* Function definition
* Parameter allocation
* Declaring variables
* Assigning variables
* Arithmetic and logical operators
* Arithmetic and logical assignment operators
* Short form arithmetic operators (e.g i++)
* If and Else statements
* For loops
* While loops
* Array declaration
* Array indexing and assignment
* Switch statements
* Break and continue keywords
