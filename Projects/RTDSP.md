# Real-Time Audio Classification Using DSP Boards 

**Feb. 2025 - April 2025**

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AlexSeferidis/RT-DSP-CW)

## Synopsis

Designed, tested and implemented 3 methods for real-time audio detection using the real-time DSP boards,the TI LAUNCHXLF28379D and BOOSTXL-AUDIO. The methods detected:

* The elevatorâ€™s floor announcement for floor nine
* A beeping sound from pressing the elevator buttons

The solutions were designed and tested using Matlab/Simulink and then deployed onto a DSP board. The 3 methods implemented were:

1. Frequency thresholding for beep detection
2. Cross correlation of frequency spectra using STFTs
3. Trained linear SVM to perform audio classification using MFCC features

## Skills

Below are the skills and experiences gained from this project:

* Competencies with Simulink and MATLAB
* Competencies using the Audio Toolbox, Embedded Coder and the Deep Learning Toolbox
* Knowledge of real-time dsp concepts and principles
