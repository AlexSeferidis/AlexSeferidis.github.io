## Synopsis

An IoT project FPGA racing game, making use of a DE10 Lite board as a controller, and game built using Unreal which interacts with a server. This was a coursework assignment for Imperial module, Information Processing. I part of the FPGA-side development, whereby a custom hardware accompanied by C program was developed to take accelerometer readings and output them to a client via UART.
