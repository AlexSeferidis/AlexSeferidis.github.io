## Synopsis

An IoT project FPGA racing game, making use of a DE10 Lite FPGA board as a controller for a game built using Unreal, which interacts with a server. This was a coursework assignment for the Imperial module, `Information Processing'. I was part of the FPGA-side development, whereby custom hardware accompanied by a C program was developed to take accelerometer readings and output them to a client via UART.  

## Skills

Below are the skills and experiences gained from the project:

* Competency with C
* Competencies using Quartus and Eclipse
* Competencies using GitHub for collaborative development
* Experience with FPGA development and workflow
* Experience working in a team
