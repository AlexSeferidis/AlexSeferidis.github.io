## Synopsis

During Summer 2024 I worked at Imperial. I was part of a team dedicated to modernising the 'Neuroscience for Machine Learners Course'. This meant converting the course into MyST Markdown, an extension of Markdown for technical, scientific communication and publication.

## Skills

Below are the skills and experiences gained from the internship:

* Competencies with MyST Markdown, GitHub actions and bash scripts
* Experience in a new product development environment, providing me with experience of satisfying stakeholder requirements, software development practices and agile development.
