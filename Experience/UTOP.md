# 'Textbook of the Future' Development

**Jun. 2024 - Sep. 2024**

## Synopsis

During Summer 2024 I worked at Imperial. I was part of a team dedicated to modernising the 'Neuroscience for Machine Learners Course'. This meant converting the course into MyST Markdown, an extension of Markdown for technical, scientific communication and publication. Further from this, I aided the development of a more interactive textbook experiences react app.

## Skills

Below are the skills and experiences gained from the internship:

* Competencies with MyST Markdown, GitHub actions and bash scripts
* Experience in a new product development environment, providing me with experience of satisfying stakeholder requirements, software development practices and agile development.
