# Quantum Networking Research Internship

**Aug. 2023 - Sep. 2023**

## Synopsis

During Summer 2023 I worked in the Smart Internet Lab at Bristol University. I was tasked with performing experiments on quantum and classical coexistence networks and fibres. I became familiar with a number of devices used for the experimental testbed such as: single photon detectors, wavelength selective switches, optical spectrum analysers, fibre channels and FPGAs. I also developed Python software to interact with some of these devices to record data and format the results.

The outcome of this internship led to a co-authorship of the paper ['A Machine Learning-Assisted Quantum and Classical Co-existence System'](https://doi.org/10.1364/OFC.2024.M2J.2)

## Skills

Below are the skills and experiences gained from the internship:

* Competencies with Python including equipment API and extensive use of numpy and matplotlib libraries
* Competencies using the aforementioned lab equipment/devices
* Knowledge of classical communication systems as well as the basics and principles of quantum communication systems
* Experience working in a team
* Experience in a lab environment
* Experience in a research environment
